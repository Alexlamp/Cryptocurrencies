# Cryptocurrencies
## Introduction
I was challenged with using unsupervised machine learning to analyze cryptocurrency data from CryproCompare. I will be diving deeper into machine learning using unsupervised algorithms, which help us explore data when we’re not sure what we’re looking for. Using unsupervised machine learning we can analyze data without a clear output in mind. To achieve these outcomes I will be:

- Preprocessing data for unsupervised learning. <br>
- Clustering data using the K-means algorithm. <br>
- Determining the best amount of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve. <br>
- Using PCA to limit features and speed up the model. <br>

## Goals
- Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
- Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
- Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
- Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

## Materials
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebok
- crypto_data.csv
